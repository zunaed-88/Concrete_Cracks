# Concrete_Cracks Image Classifier with VGG16 and ResNet50

Welcome to the Image Classifier project! This repository contains code for building, training, and evaluating an image classifier using the VGG16 and ResNet50 pre-trained models.

## Description

This project aims to classify images into predefined categories using deep learning techniques. We utilize the VGG16 and ResNet50 pre-trained models, which are well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image datasets.

## Features

- Utilizes VGG16 and ResNet50 pre-trained models for image classification.
- Allows training on custom datasets.
- Evaluates the performance of the classifiers and compares their results.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd image-classifier`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### Training

To train the image classifier:

1. Prepare your dataset and organize it according to the expected directory structure.
2. Modify the configuration file (`config.yaml`) to specify training parameters and dataset paths.
3. Run the training script: `python train.py`

### Evaluation

To evaluate the trained models:

1. Run the evaluation script: `python evaluate.py`

## Results

We present the performance metrics of the VGG16 and ResNet50 classifiers and compare their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

| Model    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| VGG16    | 0.85     | 0.87      | 0.84   | 0.85     |
| ResNet50 | 0.88     | 0.89      | 0.88   | 0.88     |
